Playing with python to analyze political text

One script (politics_whosaidwhat.py) takes data from speeches by Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump, tokenizes them and tells you whether a word you input was spoken by Hillary, Donald, both or neither.

Another script (politics_commonwords.py) analyzes the same data and tells you which of each speaker's top 20 most common words were shared or unique to them.
